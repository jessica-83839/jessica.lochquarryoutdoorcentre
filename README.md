            <h1>Scenario</h1>
            <p>Lochquarry Outdoor Centre provides outdoor activities for young people aged 6–18.

                They have recently expanded the number of different activities that they offer and would like to have a website that informs potential visitors about all the
                 exciting activities that young people can take part in at Lochquarry.
                
                 
                
                The activities that the centre offers can be split into three main categories: land-based, water-based and rope-based.
                
                 
                
                The centre would also like to include a page on the website with information about the centre and its staff, along with a homepage.
                
                 
                
                The manager of the centre has included a brief list of what each of the pages should include, but is happy to leave the overall design of the website to you.
                
                 
                
                The manager has also included text and pictures that they would like to be included on the site.
                
                 
                
                At the moment, the centre is busy during evenings and weekends with bookings from youth groups, such as Scouts and Guides, but the centre would like to expand
                 their client base to include bookings from school groups during the week and hope that this new website will help.
